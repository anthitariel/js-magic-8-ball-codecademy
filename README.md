# Javascript Magic Eight Ball Codecademy

Remember the Magic 8 ball from Interstate 60? Once, I had a task on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/magic-eight-ball-1) to build the flow for it on the console. 

I improved the idea and implemented a user-friendly prediction, using JS, HTML & CSS. Check it out [here on github pages](https://anthitariel.github.io/js-magic-8-ball-codecademy/).

## Key Features:

- **Responsive Design:** The project includes a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

- **Dynamic Responses:** The Magic Eight Ball provides dynamic responses based on the user's question, adding an element of unpredictability and fun.

- **Preventing Duplicate Questions:** Users are prevented from asking the same question multiple times consecutively to maintain a unique and engaging experience.

## Improvements Made:

- **Enhanced Magic 8 Ball Look and Functionality:** Styled the interface to resemble the Interstate 60 magic ball, hid the number when displaying the result text, and improved hover effects and button styles. Modified the magic ball waiting text.
- **Code Refactoring:** Optimized JavaScript code, removing redundant comments and optimizing the logic for better readability and consistency. Consolidated `getElementById` calls, used descriptive variable names, and removed unnecessary assignments. Adopted an event listener approach for user interactions, making the project more interactive and modern. Button Validation Enhancement: Updated the `getPrediction` function to prevent multiple predictions to repeated queries.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter a question in the input field and click on the Magic Eight Ball to get a response.
4. Enjoy the mystical and entertaining predictions.

Feel free to explore the code, and let the magic enchant you! ;-)
